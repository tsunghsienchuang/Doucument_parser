# Simple File Parser

Practice for C++ coding skills

A simple C++ project to parse a file containing date, time, and event descriptions.

## Features

- Parses a file containing events with date, time, and description.
- Stores parsed data in a structured format.
- Outputs parsed data to the console.
- Logs errors and information to a log file.

## Purpose

This project serves several purposes:

1. **Learning and practicing C++ programming**: Improve C++ skills through implementing file I/O operations, string handling, data structure manipulation, and more.
2. **Data extraction from files**: Extract useful information from structured text files, which is valuable in many real-world applications like log analysis and data import.
3. **Logging and error handling**: Demonstrate how to log program states and handle errors, which is essential for developing stable and reliable applications.
4. **Code organization and project management**: Learn how to organize code, use header files, implement modular programming, and write README documentation and use version control systems.
